## Tennessee Prescriber Database

In this project, you will be working with a database created from the 2017 Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File, available at https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/PartD2017. 

Download the database backup .tar file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/16URu_QYX_AQnELsem0MIbEsBv7VSS39e/view?usp=sharing.

Restore the database into a database called "prescribers". 

Then use it to answer the questions in the exercises. Be sure to save your work into a .sql file and push your progress to GitHub.

For your reference, an ERD is provided (ERD.png).
